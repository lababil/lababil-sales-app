## âœ… COMPLETED: SVG Logo Integration

### What was accomplished:

1. **âœ… Created LababilLogo.js Component**
   - Scalable SVG logo component with multiple variants (default, white, blue)
   - Optimized for fast loading and crisp display at any size
   - Includes network elements and camera lens design

2. **âœ… Updated Settings.js**
   - Replaced logo preview with SVG component
   - Added indication that current logo is optimized SVG
   - Maintains file upload functionality for custom logos

3. **âœ… Updated page.js**
   - Integrated SVG logo in header, login page, and receipt modal
   - Replaced all inline logo implementations with reusable component
   - Consistent branding across the application

4. **âœ… Updated constants.js**
   - Added SVG logo data for web interface
   - Maintained PNG logo for print receipts (better compatibility)

5. **âœ… Created public/logo.svg**
   - Standalone SVG file for web interface
   - Optimized gradients and design elements

6. **âœ… Print functionality maintained**
   - printUtils.js already uses SVG for PDF generation
   - Receipt printing works with both web and print formats
